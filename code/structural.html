                <p>Design of reinforced concrete structures is an introductory design course in civil engineering. In this course, basic elements governed by bending, shear, axial forces or combination of them are identified and are considered as building blocks of the whole structure.</p>

                <h2>Engineering</h2>
                <p>Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.[1] The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. </p>
