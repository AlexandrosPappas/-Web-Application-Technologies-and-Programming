                <p>Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is<br> 
                also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an<br>
                art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry.[2] In recent<br>
                centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much<br>
                of which has been transcribed.[3] Literature is a method of recording, <br>
                preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also<br>
                have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.</p>
